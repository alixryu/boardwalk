- Personal mechanical keyboard journal

## Layout
### Mechanical Layout
#### Mitosis
- columnar stagger (ortholinear)
- split keyboard layout provides tremendous benefit to typing posture
- three rows per finger (favorable switch proximity for all fingers)
- ergonomic thumb cluster (inward reach is easier than outward reach)

##### Resources
- Design: [reverse_bias](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/66588f/wireless_split_qmk_mitosis/)
- Vendor: [flashquark](https://flashquark.com/product/gb-mitosis-wireless-split-ergonomic-keyboard-w-acrylic-case/)

### Functional Layout
#### Qwerty (current layout)
- Being the de facto functional layout of most operating systems/keyboards makes it hard to move away from
#### Norman (debating whether to fully pursue)
- Close similarity to QWERTY layout allows for fast and easy learning
- Least used letters focused on inner two columns so that index finger is not strained
- cons: similarity to QWERTY means you lose QWERTY muscle memory

## Switches
### Capacitive
#### HappyHackingKeyBoard Pro2 (Topre)

### Mechanical
#### Burnt Orange BOX - purchased April 2018
- first personal mechanical switches
- tacile
- not too heavy, but heavier than brown (browns feel linear to me)
- okay switch
- a bit scratchy
- [subject to BOX switches' keycap issue](https://www.keebtalk.com/t/kailh-box-switch-stem-measurements-and-possible-problems/2926)

#### Zealio v2 67g (assumed R1) - purchased December 2018
- introduced to zeal switches by friend
- [Nathan Kim (TaehaTypes) review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUOs4_MoVnI) convinced me to try them out
- current favorite mechanical switch (of the 60+ variants I have tested so far)
- incredibly tactile, and smooth, has a clean bump in both press and release.
- a bit loud to type at home at night
- spring/leaf sound is not the most pleasant to hear

#### Zealio v2 67g (assumed R2+) - purchased March 2019
- bought another set from [zealpc](https://zealpc.net/) only to find out the switches are different from my original set (confirmed through email)
- bump on release is lighter than original Zealio v2 67g (I prefer the original, more prominent bump more)
- is still incredibly tactile, and is smoother than original v2 set (as a trade off to the lighter release tactility)
- a bit loud to type at home at night
- spring/leaf sound has improved vs original v2 (again, as a trade off to the lighter release tactility)

#### Zilent v2 67g (assumed R2+) - purchased March 2019
- silent version of Zealio switches
- purchased for night/home typing purposes
- impressively similar feeling to Zealio switches

## Key Caps
### Profile
### Anything but DSA
- I need the profile to create a concave shape since my keyboards are flat

### Material
#### PBT
##### [blank OEM profile keycaps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XKFPYZB/) - colors: Black, Dark Grey

#### ABS
##### [GMK Metropolis](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/gmk-metropolis-gb)

## Journey
#### HHKB Pro2 (topre, 60% layout, little hand movement to reach all keys)
- great compatibility with Vim binding
#### Attempt to have identical set up at work and home
- HHKB-BT vs HHKB Hasu mod research
- into rabbit hole of mechanical keyboard world
#### First Mitosis keyboard with BOX Burnt Orange switches
- very satisfied with mechanical layout
- QMK firmware is very convenient
- Wanted hot swappable set up for my Mitosis keyboard
#### Second Mitosis Keyboard with hot swapability
- first personal build (still outsourced soldering to Flashquark)
- used [gold holtites](https://zealpc.net/collections/switches/products/gold-plated-hot-swap-sockets-for-pcbs) for hot swap functionality
- using holtites is more reliable than Kailh hot swap sockets in my personal experience
- plate no longer soldered to pcb, which allows for utilizing any plate material
#### Third Mitosis Keyboard (replica build of second Mitosis)
- in progress
- planning on making a detailed build log
- planning to use metallic plates

## Projects
- [x] Hot Swappable Mitosis
- [ ] Different material plates for Mitosis
- [ ] AES128 for Mitosis wireless communication
